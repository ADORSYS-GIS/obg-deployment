# Task Description:
Deploy a multi-container microservices application using Docker Compose on a single AWS EC2 instance, which is placed in a private subnet behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB is the public entry point, with HTTPS enabled for all subdomains (*.obgdeb.com) using an ACM certificate. All public access is routed through the ALB, and DNS records point to the ALB. The EC2 instance is not directly exposed to the internet.

## Deployment Flow and Architecture

1. **Networking Setup**  
   - Create a VPC with public and private subnets in single AZ (eu-north-1a).
   - Deploy a NAT Gateway in the public subnet with an Elastic IP to enable outbound internet access for private subnet resources.  
   - Application Load Balancer (ALB) is deployed in the public subnet and acts as the public entry point for all traffic.  
   - Private subnet hosts a single EC2 instance running Docker Compose.  
   - Route tables ensure the private subnet routes outbound traffic via the NAT Gateway.
   - Security Groups:
     - ALB SG allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS (80/443) from anywhere.
     - EC2 SG allows inbound traffic from the ALB SG (port 80 for app traffic).
     - Outbound rules allow all necessary egress (0.0.0.0/0) for updates, SSM, etc.

2. **Domain and SSL Setup**  
   - Use Route53 hosted zone for `obgdeb.com`.
   - Create a wildcard DNS record `*.obgdeb.com` pointing to the ALB (not the EC2 or NAT Gateway).
   - Provision ACM SSL certificate for:
     - Primary domain: `obgdeb.com`
     - SAN: `*.obgdeb.com`
   - Validate ACM cert via DNS validation using Route53.
   - ALB uses the ACM certificate for HTTPS termination.

3. **EC2 Instance Provisioning**  
   - Launch an EC2 instance (t3.large) in the private subnet of eu-north-1a.
   - Attach an IAM Role with SSM and CloudWatch permissions.
   - Security Group allows inbound from ALB only.
   - Use user_data script to:
     - Install Docker, Docker Compose, Git.
     - Clone your GitHub repo (https://github.com/kouamschekina/obg-deployment).
     - Run `docker compose up -d` to start containers including Traefik and all microservices.

4. **Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Traefik**  
   - ALB terminates HTTPS and forwards HTTP traffic to the EC2 instance on port 80.
   - Traefik runs as a reverse proxy inside Docker on the EC2 instance, routing traffic to the appropriate containers/services based on subdomain and path.
   - All public traffic flows: **Internet â†’ Route53 DNS â†’ ALB (HTTPS) â†’ EC2 (private subnet, HTTP) â†’ Traefik â†’ Containers**

5. **Monitoring and Logging**  
   - Enable CloudWatch agent on EC2 for metrics and logs collection.
   - Configure CloudWatch alarms on key metrics (CPU, memory, disk).

6. **Access and Management**  
   - Use AWS Systems Manager (SSM) for remote instance access (no open SSH ports required).
   - Manage updates and deployments by pushing code changes to GitHub and triggering redeploys via scripts or CI/CD pipeline.

## Current Architecture Status

### âœ… **What's Working:**
- **VPC**: Single AZ setup with public/private subnets in eu-north-1a
- **NAT Gateway**: Single NAT Gateway with Elastic IP for private subnet internet access
- **ALB**: Application Load Balancer with HTTPS termination
- **EC2**: Single t3.large instance in private subnet
- **Security Groups**: Properly configured for ALB â†’ EC2 traffic
- **DNS**: Route53 with wildcard records pointing to ALB
- **SSL**: ACM certificate for domain and subdomains
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms and metrics
- **IAM**: Proper roles for EC2 instance

### âœ… **Cost Optimization:**
- **Single AZ**: Reduced NAT Gateway costs by ~$45/month
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: All resources properly utilized
- **Simple Management**: Single instance, single AZ setup

### ðŸ’° **Cost Analysis:**
- **EC2 t3.large**: ~$30/month
- **NAT Gateway (1 AZ)**: ~$45/month
- **Route53**: ~$0.50/month
- **CloudWatch**: ~$5/month
- **Data Transfer**: Variable
- **Total**: ~$80/month

## Future Scaling Options

### Option 1: Multi-Instance Single AZ (High Availability)
- **Cost**: Additional ~$30/month for second EC2
- **Changes**: Add second EC2 instance in same AZ
- **Impact**: Better availability, higher cost
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$110/month

### Option 2: Multi-AZ Setup (Production Grade)
- **Cost**: Additional ~$45/month for second AZ
- **Changes**: Add second AZ with EC2 instance
- **Impact**: High availability, higher cost
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$125/month

### Option 3: Keep Current (Development Setup)
- **Recommendation**: Keep as-is for development/testing
- **Note**: Cost-optimized single instance setup
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$80/month
